Introducing ghalashare

The core business idea is to build a trusted marketplace for storage needs by offering people with items on their hands  a cheaper (and potentially easier) alternative to traditional self-storage solutions â€” and, on the host side, a platform to earn a little money for not having to do too much (just having space where you can let stuff safely sit).
